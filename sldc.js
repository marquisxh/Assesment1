// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

Planning
Analysis of Requirements
Design
Testing & Integration
Implementation
Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisRequirements = "This is the second step, in which requires coming up with the first ideas for prototypes. Specific details are needed for a new system."
const Design = "This is the third step, in which details will be outlined for the application overall such as User interfaces, System interfaces, Network requirements and Databases."
const TestingIntegration = "This is the fourth step, in which Developers will check thoroughly for any bugs that needs to be tracked and fixed so a test can be reran."
const Implementation = "This is the fifth step, where everything comes together overall. Different modules will be integrated into the primary source code by controlling the environment to look for any defects and errors down the line."
const Maintain = "This is the last step, in which thedevelopers move into maintanence mode. In this process issues can be patched up or detected that were not seen previously. Issues reported by end users will also be handled during this stage."
